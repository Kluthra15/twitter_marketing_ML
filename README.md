Public Repo for my data science project which I am doing as part of my data science mentorship. 

# Social Media Marketing in the age of Twitter and Natural Language Processing (NLP)

The aim of this project was inspired by the rise in the popularity of social media and its impact on consumerism and customer psychology. The objective of this project
was to be able to find the best-fit influencers on twitter to promote brands/products/ideas/ based on their profile and tweet history. These influencers need not necessarily be 
public figures, rather those with a strong following, active accounts, and high & relevant community involvment.
