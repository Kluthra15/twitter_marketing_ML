Public Repo for my data science project which I am doing as part of my data science mentorship.

## PROJECT SCOPE:
The goal of this project is to identify the key features of an influencer's online presence that are most correlated with successful brand promotions. By understanding these key features, we can help brands make more informed decisions about which influencers to work with and how to optimize their campaigns.

## DATA GATHERING:
I will solve this problem by using web-scraping techniques to extract social media data and examining all the quantitative, qualitative, visual, and textual data available on influencers currently promoting brands. This will help me determine the features most important to successful engagement of brands being promoted by influencers on social media. 

Lastly, this information will be fed into machine learning algorithms for clustering influencers by best-fit for each category of product, for a recommendation system to be able to recommend specific influencers to promote specific brands.
The final product should be able to help businesses find influencers for their brand promotion in a more efficient and effective manner than the baseline of promoting to random influencers.
